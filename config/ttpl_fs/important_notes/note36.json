  "additional_instructions": "Output Structure:\n\n**NOTE 35: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS**\n\n1.  **A. Contingent Liabilities**: Sum of potential obligations (claims, guarantees, disputes).\n2.  **B. Commitments**: Sum of non-cancellable future spending, primarily **Capital Commitments**.\n\nAccounting Context:\n-   This note complies with **Ind AS 37** (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets).\n-   **Contingent Liabilities** are potential obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. They are NOT recognized on the Balance Sheet but disclosed.\n-   **Commitments** are future expenditures (often for capital expenditure - Capex) where the company is legally obligated, but the liability is not yet incurred. They are disclosed separately from liabilities.\n-   All amounts should be presented as positive (disclosure only).\n\nFormatting:\n-   Format all amounts in the Indian numbering system (e.g., 1,23,456)."
