This is then reconciled against **Consideration Paid** (Share Capital Issued) to determine the **Capital Reserve**.\n\nAccounting Context:\n-   This transaction is typically accounted for at **carrying values** (book values) under the 'common control' exception.\n\nFormatting:\n-   Format all amounts in the Indian numbering system (e.g., 1,23,456).\n-   Liability/Consideration lines should be shown as deductions."
