  "additional_instructions": "This note captures all other income items not related to core operations. AGGREGATION LOGIC: If multiple accounts map to the same minor category (e.g., 3 accounts for 'Miscellaneous income'), perform algebraic summation: add all values as they are (positive + positive + negative). Example: If Account A = 10,000, Account B = 5,000, Account C = -3,000, then final = 10,000 + 5,000 + (-3,000) = 12,000. After algebraic aggregation, present the final net amount as positive value. IMPORTANT: Always generate this note even if no matching accounts are found in the trial balance. Display zero (0) values for all line items when no data is available."
