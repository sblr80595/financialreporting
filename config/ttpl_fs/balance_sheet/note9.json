'Unsecured, considered good' - from category 'Trade receivables- Unsecured, considered good' (Debit balance).\n3.  'Unsecured, considered impaired' - from category 'Allowance for bad and doubtful debts' with **SIGN FLIPPED** (Credit balance is shown as a positive Debit addition to gross up the total).\n4.  Show **SUBTOTAL_TRADE_RECEIVABLES (Gross)**.\n5.  Show **Impairment allowance** as header.\n6.  **'Less: Provision for doubtful debts'** - SAME category 'Allowance for bad and doubtful debts' but displayed as a deduction (e.g., in parentheses).\n7.  Show final total **TOTAL_TRADE_RECEIVABLES (Net)** = Gross Subtotal - Deduction.\n8.  Key Logic: The same allowance amount is used twice with opposite signs to arrive at the net book value.\n9.  Format all amounts in Indian numbering system (e.g., 1,23,456)."
