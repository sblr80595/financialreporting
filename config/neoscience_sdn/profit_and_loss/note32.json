  "additional_instructions": "This note discloses the income tax expense recognized in the statement of profit and loss, broken down into its components.\n\nGL Mapping:\n- **Current tax**: GL 8000/00000 TAXATION (Ind AS Minor: 'Current Tax')\n  This represents the current period's tax liability based on taxable income.\n\n- **Deferred tax charge/(credit)**: D.Tax (Ind AS Minor: 'Deferred tax charge/(credit)')\n  This represents the movement in deferred tax assets/liabilities during the period.\n  - Positive value = Deferred tax charge (increases tax expense)\n  - Negative value = Deferred tax credit (reduces tax expense)\n  In the trial balance, this appears as a negative value when it's a credit.\n\n- **Earlier years tax adjustments (net)**: E.tax (Ind AS Minor: 'Earlier years tax adjustments (net)')\n  This represents adjustments related to prior period taxes (assessments, revisions, etc.)\n  - Positive value = Additional tax expense for prior years\n  - Negative value = Reversal/refund for prior years\n\nCalculation Formula:\nTotal Income Tax Expense = Current Tax + Deferred Tax Charge/(Credit) + Earlier Years Adjustments\n\nExample for June 2025:\n- Current tax: ₹7,11,000\n- Deferred tax credit: (₹85,000) [shown as negative in TB]\n- Earlier years adjustments: ₹0\n- Total: ₹7,11,000 - ₹85,000 = ₹6,26,000\n\nPresentation Notes:\n1. Use algebraic summation - DO NOT convert negative values to positive\n2. Show deferred tax credit in parentheses if negative: (85,000)\n3. If earlier years adjustment is zero, show as '-' or '0'\n4. The final total line is bolded and represents the total tax expense in P&L\n5. This note can be expanded with section (b) for OCI tax effects if applicable\n\nSchedule III Compliance:\nThis format follows Schedule III of Companies Act, 2013 requirements for tax disclosure in financial statements."
