Show subtotal of good + impaired receivables (e.g., 3,19,16,339 + 3,63,306 = 3,19,79,645)\n5. Show 'Impairment allowance' as header (no amount)\n6. 'Less: Allowance against expected credit loss' - SAME category 'Allowance for bad and doubtful debts' but displayed as -(3,63,306) or (3,63,306)\n7. Show final total = Subtotal - Allowance (e.g., 3,19,79,645 - 3,63,306 = 3,13,16,339)\n8. Key Logic: Both 'Unsecured, considered impaired' and 'Less: Allowance...' use the SAME source data but with OPPOSITE signs\n10. Format all amounts in Indian numbering system without \u20b9 symbol."
