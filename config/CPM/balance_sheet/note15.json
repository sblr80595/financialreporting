  "additional_instructions": "Output Structure:\n\n**NOTE 15: OTHER EQUITY**\n\nPresentation Requirements:\n1.  **(i) Retained earnings** (Header)\n    * `Balance at the beginning of the year`: **Crucial calculation.** This will sum the raw values (debit/positive and credit/negative) from 'Dividend paid' and 'Retained earnings' GLs. It will then flip the sign of the total sum (e.g., if sum is -80,000, it will display 80,000).\n    * `Profit for the year`: **This is a placeholder.** The template will show 0. This value must be provided externally.\n    * `Balance at the end of the year (Retained Earnings)`: Calculated as (Beginning Balance + Profit).\n\n2.  **(ii) Employee Stock Options Reserve** (Header)\n    * `Balance at the end of the year (ESOP)`: This will sum the GLs under 'Share Based Payment Reserve' (which is likely a negative credit balance) and then flip the sign to display a positive number.\n\n3.  **Total Other equity** (Total): Calculated as `Balance at the end of the year (Retained Earnings)` + `Balance at the end of the year (ESOP)`.\n\nAccounting Context:\n-   This note shows the components and movement in 'Other Equity'.\n-   The calculation for 'Balance at the beginning of the year' correctly nets the opening retained earnings (credit) against any dividends paid (debit) to arrive at the true opening balance.\n\nCritial Limitation:\n-   **'Profit for the year' is not in the trial balance.** It is the result of the P&L statement. The `BALANCE_SHEET_TEMPLATE` cannot take this external input, so 'Profit for the year' will be 0 and the subsequent totals will be incorrect unless the prompt is manually modified before execution."
