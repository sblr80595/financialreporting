MSME Disclosure Section (as per MSME Act requirements):\n   - 'Total outstanding dues of micro enterprises and small enterprises' - show '-' or specific amount if MSME dues exist\n   - 'Total outstanding dues of creditors other than micro enterprises and small enterprises*' - calculate as: -(SUMIF for 'Due to others' + 'Accrued expenses' + 'Amounts due to related companies')\n   - Add blank row for spacing\n\n2. Trade Payables Breakdown:\n   - 'Due to others' - calculate as: -(SUMIF for 'Due to others' + SUMIF for 'Accrued expenses')\n     Formula logic: =-(SUMIF(TB_final!$L:CC,'Due to others',TB_final!CC:CC) + SUMIF(TB_final!$L:CC,'Accrued expenses',TB_final!CC:CC))\n   - 'Due to related companies' - calculate as: -(SUMIF for 'Amounts due to related companies')\n     Formula logic: =-(SUMIF(TB_final!$L:CC,'Amounts due to related companies',TB_final!CC:CC))\n   - Show total = Due to others + Due to related companies\n\n3. Example values:\n   - MSME dues: - (dash if no MSME payables)\n   - Non-MSME dues*: 2,66,16,637\n   - Due to others: 2,66,16,637 (includes regular payables and accruals)\n   - Due to related companies: - (dash if no related party payables)\n   - Total: 2,66,16,637\n\n5. Format all amounts in Indian numbering system without \u20b9 symbol.\n6. The negative formula -(SUMIF) converts credit balances (negative in TB) to positive presentation values.\n7. MSME disclosure is mandatory as per Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006.\n8. The asterisk (*) on non-MSME line indicates it equals the final total when no MSME dues exist.\n9. Trade payables are liabilities with credit balances - use negative formula for conversion.\n10. Related party payables require separate disclosure as per Schedule III and Ind AS 24."
