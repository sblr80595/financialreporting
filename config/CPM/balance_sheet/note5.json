Ltd.'\n    GL Code: 13020195 - Hausen Bernstein Co Ltd\n    (No impairment)\n\nTOTAL CALCULATION:\n- System should sum ALL investment line items (both gross investments and impairments)\n- Impairment values are already negative in the trial balance, so direct summation will give net value\n- DO NOT hardcode the total value\n- Calculate total dynamically: Sum of all GL codes listed in categories\n- Net investment value = Sum(all gross investment GL codes) + Sum(all impairment GL codes, which are negative)\n\nFORMATTING NOTES:\n- Each investment description should include: number of shares, par value per share, currency, company name\n- Impairment lines should be indented and shown with 'Less: Impairment in value of investments'\n- Impairment values from trial balance are typically negative; display them as negative/in brackets\n- Bold the final total line\n- Double-underline the final total\n- Right-align all numbers\n- Maintain blank rows between investments for readability\n\nDATA EXTRACTION LOGIC:\n- For each GL code in categories, extract the closing balance from the period column\n- Investment GL codes (13020030, 13020050, etc.) typically have positive debit balances\n- Impairment provision GL codes (13020031, 13020051, etc.) typically have negative credit balances\n- Sum all values algebraically to get total net investment\n- Display impairment amounts with the negative sign or in brackets\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- NO hardcoded amounts should be used\n- ALL values must be filtered and summed from trial balance based on GL codes\n- The system should handle cases where:\n  * GL code exists with zero balance (show as blank or dash)\n  * GL code has negative balance for investment (unusual, but system should handle)\n  * Impairment GL code doesn't exist (skip the impairment line)\n- Total line must sum ALL preceding investment lines algebraically"
