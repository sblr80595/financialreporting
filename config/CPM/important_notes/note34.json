  "additional_instructions": "## Calculation Steps:\n\n**For Mar'25:**\n\n1. **GL Breakdown (Output 1):** Filter CPM.csv for rows where 'Ind AS Minor' matches any of the categories: Trade receivables, Cash and cash equivalents, Loans, Other financial assets, Borrowings, Trade payables, Lease liabilities, Other financial liabilities. Extract GL Code, GL Code Description, Ind AS Major, Ind AS Minor, and Total Mar'25 values. Compute algebraic sum.\n\n2. **Credit Risk Exposure (Output 2):** From Balance_Sheet.xlsx, extract all financial assets (Trade receivables, Cash and cash equivalents, Loans, Other financial assets) for Mar'25. Sum these to get Total Credit Risk Exposure.\n\n3. **Liquidity Risk Analysis (Output 3):** From Balance_Sheet.xlsx, identify all financial liabilities (Borrowings, Trade payables, Lease liabilities, Other financial liabilities). Classify each by contractual maturity:\n   - **Less than 1 year:** Current portion of borrowings, current lease liabilities, trade payables, other current financial liabilities\n   - **1 to 5 years:** Non-current borrowings (if maturity info available), non-current lease liabilities\n   - **More than 5 years:** Long-term borrowings (if maturity info available)\n\n   If specific maturity data is not available in Balance Sheet, use reasonable assumptions:\n   - Current liabilities \u2192 Less than 1 year\n   - Non-current liabilities \u2192 1 to 5 years (unless clearly long-term)\n\n---\n\n## Arithmetic Rules:\n- Perform algebraic summation: respect positive and negative signs.\n- For Credit Risk: Sum all asset values (all typically positive).\n- For Liquidity Risk: Sum liability values by maturity bucket. Total After 1 Year = (1 to 5 years) + (More than 5 years). Grand Total = (Less than 1 year) + (1 to 5 years) + (More than 5 years).\n- Round consistently (2 decimals) only after aggregation.\n\n---\n\n## Output Requirements:\n1. **GL Breakdown Table** - Show all relevant financial instrument GLs with Mar'25 column\n2. **Credit Risk Exposure Table** - Show all financial assets and Total Credit Risk Exposure for Mar'25\n3. **Liquidity Risk Table** - Show all financial liabilities classified by maturity (Less than 1 year, 1 to 5 years, More than 5 years) with calculated totals\n4. Currency: **MYR** (Malaysian Ringgit)\n5. Format amounts in Malaysian Ringgit style: MYR 1,23,456 or MYR -1,23,456\n\n---\n\n## Important Notes:\n- If historical data (Mar'24, Mar'23) exists in Balance Sheet, include in Credit Risk table as additional columns\n- For Liquidity Risk, if maturity breakdown is not explicitly available in Balance Sheet, classify as:\n  - Current liabilities = Less than 1 year\n  - Non-current liabilities = 1 to 5 years\n- Include a footnote if maturity assumptions were made\n- Ensure all totals reconcile with Balance Sheet figures"
