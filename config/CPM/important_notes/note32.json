  "additional_instructions": "## Calculation Steps:\n\n**For Mar'25:**\n\n1. **Filter Trial Balance GLs:**\n \u00a0 - Current tax: All GLs where 'Ind AS Minor' = 'Current tax'\n \u00a0 - Deferred tax: All GLs where 'Ind AS Minor' = 'Deferred tax'\n\n2. **Compute Tax Expense Components:**\n \u00a0 - Current Tax Expense = Algebraic sum of current tax GLs\n \u00a0 - Deferred Tax Expense = Algebraic sum of deferred tax GLs\n \u00a0 - Total Tax Expense = Current + Deferred\n\n3. **Calculate Profit Before Tax (PBT):**\n \u00a0 - Sum all GLs where BSPL = 'PL' (Profit & Loss)\n \u00a0 - EXCLUDE GLs with 'Ind AS Minor' = 'Current tax' or 'Deferred tax'\n \u00a0 - PBT = Sum of all P&L items before tax (Cross-validate with 'PL_Statement_XLSX' where possible)\n\n4. **Compute Tax at Statutory Rate:**\n \u00a0 - Tax at 24% = PBT \u00d7 0.24\n\n5. **Identify Permanent Differences:**\n \u00a0 - Income not taxable: Check auxiliary files or use default of \u20b91,00,000\n \u00a0 \u00a0 - Tax impact = -(amount \u00d7 0.24)\n \u00a0 - Expenses not deductible: Check auxiliary files or use default of \u20b92,50,000\n \u00a0 \u00a0 - Tax impact = +(amount \u00d7 0.24)\n\n6. **Calculate Balancing Figure:**\n \u00a0 - Balancing Figure = Total Tax Expense - [Tax at 24% + Expense Adjustments - Income Adjustments]\n \u00a0 - This represents other adjustments, timing differences, or unrecognised DTA\n\n---\n\n## Arithmetic Rules:\n- Perform algebraic summation: respect positive and negative signs\n- Example: [\u20b91,00,000, \u20b9-20,000, \u20b930,000] \u2192 Net = \u20b91,10,000\n- Treat values in parentheses \"()\" or with \"CR\" as negative\n- Round to nearest rupee (no decimals) after all calculations\n- Preserve signs in all intermediate calculations\n\n---\n\n## Output Requirements:\n1. **Detailed GL Breakdown** - Show every GL with signed amounts\n2. **Summary Table** - Tax expense components for P&L\n3. **ETR Reconciliation** - Show how statutory rate reconciles to effective rate\n4. Generate all three sections for the ONLY period (Mar'25)\n5. Use Indian numbering format: \u20b91,23,456 (not \u20b9123,456)\n6. For negative amounts: \u20b9-1,23,456 or (\u20b91,23,456)\n\n---\n\n## Validation Checks:\n- Verify that Total Tax Expense in Summary Table matches Reconciliation total\n- Ensure PBT calculation excludes tax items\n- Confirm algebraic integrity: sum of parts = total\n- Cross-check auxiliary file data with trial balance where possible\n- If auxiliary files are missing data, clearly state that defaults were used"
