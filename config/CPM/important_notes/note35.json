Use algebraic sum for the total.\n\n2. **Capital Management Components (Output 2):** Extract data from Balance_Sheet_XLSX to build the Net Debt (A) and Total Capital (B) tables. Show columns for Mar'25, Mar'24, and Mar'23 (if available).\n    - **Net Debt (A)**: Sum all debt components (borrowings, lease liabilities, etc.) and algebraically subtract Cash and Other bank balances.\n    - **Total Capital (B)**: Sum all equity components.\n\n3. **Gearing Ratio Calculation (Output 3):** Calculate Capital and net debt (C = A + B) and Gearing ratio = (C / A) * 100 for Mar'25.\n\n---\n\n## Output Requirements:\n1. **GL Breakdown Table** - Show all relevant GLs with Mar'25 column only.\n2. **Capital Management Components Table** - Show breakdown with columns: Particulars | 31 March 2025 (MYR) | 31 March 2024 (MYR) | 31 March 2023 (MYR). All amounts must be positive, except for cash deductions.\n3. **Gearing Ratio Table** - Show calculation table for Mar'25.\n4. Currency: MYR (Malaysian Ringgit). Format amounts in Indian Rupee style (e.g., \u20b91,23,456 but use MYR currency symbol)."
