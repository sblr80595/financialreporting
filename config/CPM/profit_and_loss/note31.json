These items belong in Note 25 (Other Income).\n\n2. **Loss on sale of PPE - DEBITS ONLY**: For the line 'Loss on sale of property, plant and equipment':\n   - Find all GLs where 'Ind AS Minor' matches: 'Profit/Loss on sale of PPE', 'Loss on disposal of assets', or 'Gain/Loss on disposal of assets'\n   - Sum ONLY the debit (positive) balances\n   - IGNORE all credit balances (these are gains, not losses)\n   - The result represents total loss on disposal\n\n3. **Miscellaneous expenses - Apply Exclusions**: For 'Miscellaneous expenses':\n   - Include GLs where 'Ind AS Minor' is 'Miscellaneous expenses', 'General expenses', or 'Misc.'\n   - EXCLUDE any GLs that also contain keywords: 'foreign exchange', 'forex', 'FX', 'disposal', 'sale of PPE', or 'rent'\n   - Sum the remaining GLs algebraically\n\n4. **GL Breakdown**: Include 'Ind AS Minor' column in the GL-level breakdown table for transparency.\n\nThese rules prevent double-counting and ensure proper classification across notes."
