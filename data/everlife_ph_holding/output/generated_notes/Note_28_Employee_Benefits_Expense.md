### Commentary:

Based on the trial balance data provided for the period ending June 2025, **no employee benefits expense accounts were identified**. The trial balance does not contain any GL accounts mapped to the following Ind AS Minor categories:

- "Salaries, wages and Bonus"
- "Contributions to provident and other funds"  
- "Staff welfare expenses"

The trial balance primarily contains Balance Sheet items (cash, investments, liabilities, equity) and limited Profit & Loss items (miscellaneous expenses, bank charges, rent, professional fees, interest income/expense). There are no entries related to employee compensation, statutory contributions, or staff welfare.

**This suggests that either:**
1. The company had no employee-related expenses during this period, or
2. Employee benefit expenses are recorded under different GL account classifications not mapped to the standard Ind AS Minor categories for employee benefits, or
3. This is a holding/investment company structure with minimal operating staff

The note has been presented with zero values to maintain Schedule III compliance and completeness of financial statement presentation.
