# NOTE 26: PURCHASES OF STOCK-IN-TRADE

## Analysis of Trial Balance Data

After careful examination of the provided trial balance data for the period **(Unaudited) Jun'25**, I have identified that there are **NO accounts** classified under the Ind AS Minor category "Purchases of traded goods".

The trial balance contains only Balance Sheet items (Cash, Investments, Liabilities, Equity) and Profit & Loss items related to expenses (Miscellaneous, Professional Fees, Interest, etc.) and other income. There are no purchase-related accounts for stock-in-trade.

## Explanatory Notes:

**Purchases of traded goods**: This line item represents the total purchases of goods acquired for resale during the period. As per the trial balance provided, no accounts were classified under "Purchases of traded goods" in the Ind AS Minor category.

**Components typically included in Purchases of Stock-in-Trade:**
- Main purchases of goods for resale
- Freight inward/carriage inward on purchases
- Custom duty on imports
- Packaging materials related to purchases
- Any other direct costs attributable to bringing goods to their present location and condition
- Less: Purchase returns (credit entries)
- Less: Discounts received on purchases (credit entries)

**Note on Inventory Treatment**: Opening stock and closing stock are NOT included in this note as they belong to Note 27 (Changes in Inventories of Finished Goods, Work-in-Progress and Stock-in-Trade).

**Observation**: Based on the trial balance structure, the entity appears to be an investment holding company (Everlife Holdings Pte Limited) with investments in associates (Lifeline Diagnostic Inc.) rather than a trading company. This explains the absence of stock-in-trade purchase transactions.
