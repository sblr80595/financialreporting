### B. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company. The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.

**Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on Trade Receivables:**

As at June 30, 2025, the Company does not have any trade receivables outstanding. Therefore, no provision for Expected Credit Loss has been recognized.

---

### C. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risks.

#### (i) Foreign Currency Risk Sensitivity

The Company's functional currency is Indian Rupees (INR), however, certain transactions and balances are denominated in foreign currencies (SGD and USD). The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures.

**Foreign Currency Exposure as at June 30, 2025:**

| Particulars | Currency | Amount in Foreign Currency | Amount in INR (₹) |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Accruals | SGD | [To be specified] | 1,565,986.72 |
| Accruals | USD | [To be specified] | 223,237.60 |
| Loans from Related Parties | [Currency] | [To be specified] | 243,547,464.00 |

**Sensitivity Analysis:** A 5% appreciation/depreciation of the INR against foreign currencies would impact the profit or loss and equity by approximately ₹[calculated amount].

#### (ii) Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company's loan from related parties.

**Sensitivity Analysis:** A 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates would impact the profit or loss by approximately ₹[calculated amount based on interest-bearing liabilities].

---

### D. CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return to stakeholders through the optimization of the debt and equity balance. The Company monitors capital using gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt.
