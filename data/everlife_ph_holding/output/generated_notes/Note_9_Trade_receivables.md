## GL Level Breakdown for NOTE 9

After carefully reviewing the trial balance data provided, I have filtered for entries with 'Ind AS Minor' categories that would typically constitute "Trade Receivables" for Schedule III purposes.

**Result: No Trade Receivables identified in the trial balance**

The trial balance provided does not contain any GL accounts classified under the 'Ind AS Minor' categories that would constitute Trade Receivables such as:
- Trade Receivables
- Receivables from customers
- Bills receivables
- Debts outstanding for goods sold or services rendered
- Contract assets

The only receivable-type accounts present are:
- Interest receivable (classified under "Other current assets")
- Due from a related party (classified under "Other current assets")

These are correctly classified as **Other Current Assets** and not as Trade Receivables per Schedule III requirements.
