### Explanation:

Based on the trial balance data provided, there are no entries classified under the 'Ind AS Minor' category for "Other bank balances" as per Schedule III requirements.

**Note:** The trial balance contains:
- **Bank Balance** entries (₹51,240.57 and ₹13,86,931.78) which are classified under "Cash and cash equivalents" - these would typically appear in **NOTE 10: Cash and Cash Equivalents**, not in Other Bank Balances.

**Other bank balances** typically include:
- Earmarked balances (unpaid dividend accounts, margin money, security deposits)
- Balances held as security
- Repatriation restrictions
- Bank deposits with maturity > 3 months but < 12 months

Since no such categories are present in the provided trial balance data under the appropriate 'Ind AS Minor' classification, the value for this note is correctly reported as **₹0**.
