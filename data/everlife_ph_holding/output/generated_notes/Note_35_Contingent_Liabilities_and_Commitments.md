## Notes:
1. The trial balance provided does not contain any GL accounts classified under the specific 'Ind AS Minor' categories required for Contingent Liabilities and Commitments.
2. This note requires both quantitative disclosure (shown above as ₹0) and detailed narrative explanations for each contingent liability and commitment, which should be provided separately based on actual legal and contractual assessments.
3. Companies should disclose the nature, timing, and estimated financial effect of contingent liabilities, even if the amounts cannot be reliably measured.
4. If the Company has any off-balance sheet contingent liabilities or commitments, they should be properly classified in the trial balance for accurate disclosure.
