## **Explanation:**

Based on the trial balance data provided for the period **(Unaudited) Jun'25**, there are **no general ledger entries** classified under the 'Ind AS Minor' category for **"Right-of-use assets"**.

The trial balance contains various Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss accounts, but none are categorized as Right-of-use assets as per Ind AS 116 (Leases). While there is a rental expense entry (Rental - Premises - Other RP: ₹15,000), this appears in the Profit & Loss statement and does not constitute a Right-of-use asset on the Balance Sheet.

Right-of-use assets would typically appear when an entity recognizes lease assets under Ind AS 116, where the lessee capitalizes the present value of lease payments as an asset with a corresponding lease liability. Since no such classification exists in the provided data, the note reflects a **nil balance** for this period.

**Schedule III Compliance:** This presentation is in accordance with Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013, which requires separate disclosure of Right-of-use assets as a distinct line item in the Balance Sheet.
