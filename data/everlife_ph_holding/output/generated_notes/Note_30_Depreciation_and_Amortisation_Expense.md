## Important Notes:

1. **No Depreciation/Amortisation Recorded**: The trial balance for the period ending June 25 does not contain any entries under the 'Ind AS Minor' classifications for depreciation on PPE, depreciation on ROU assets, or amortisation of intangible assets.

2. **Possible Reasons**:
   - The entity may not have recorded depreciation for this period
   - The entity may not own depreciable property, plant and equipment
   - The entity may not have right-of-use assets under Ind AS 116
   - The entity may not have intangible assets requiring amortisation
   - Depreciation entries may be classified under different 'Ind AS Minor' categories not specified in the instructions

3. **Recommendation**: Please verify if depreciation and amortisation expenses exist under different classification codes in the trial balance, or confirm if the entity genuinely has no such expenses for this period.
