# NOTE 41: REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

## ANALYSIS AND GL LEVEL BREAKDOWN

**Period: (Unaudited) Jun'25**

### Data Processing Summary:

After careful examination of the trial balance data provided, I have filtered all entries by the 'Minor' column (equivalent to 'Ind AS Minor') to identify revenue from contracts with customers as per Ind AS 115.

**Categories Searched:**
- Revenue - Sale of Goods
- Revenue - Rendering of Services
- Revenue - Commission Income
- Revenue - Interest Income (for operating revenue context)
- Revenue - Other Operating Revenue
- Revenue Timing - Recognised at a Point in Time
- Revenue Timing - Recognised Over Time

### Findings:

**No GL accounts matching the specified revenue categories were found in the trial balance.**

The trial balance contains:
- Interest Income (₹695.77 credit) - classified under "Other Income" (non-operating income)
- Dividend Income (₹0) - classified under "Other Income" (non-operating income)
- Various expense accounts
- Balance sheet items

**Note:** The Interest Income and Dividend Income identified in the trial balance are classified as "Other Income" rather than operating revenue from contracts with customers under Ind AS 115. These would typically be reported separately in the P&L statement under "Other Income" rather than "Revenue from Operations."
