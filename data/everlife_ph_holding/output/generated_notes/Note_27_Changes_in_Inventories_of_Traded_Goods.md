## EXPLANATORY NOTES:

1. **Data Availability:** The trial balance provided does not contain any accounts classified under the required 'Ind AS Minor' categories for traded goods inventory.

2. **Company Nature:** Based on the trial balance structure, this appears to be a holding/investment company (Everlife Holdings Pte Limited) with significant investments in associates (Lifeline Diagnostic Inc. - ₹64,00,00,000) rather than a trading company.

3. **Schedule III Compliance:** As per Schedule III requirements, this note has been generated showing zero values for both opening and closing inventories, resulting in zero net change in inventories of traded goods.

4. **Reconciliation:** The net change of ₹0 correctly reflects that there were no traded goods inventory transactions during the period ended June 2025.
