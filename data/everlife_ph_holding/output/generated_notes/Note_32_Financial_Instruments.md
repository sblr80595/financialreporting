# NOTE 32: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

## IMPORTANT NOTICE
⚠️ **Data Limitation Identified**: The provided trial balance does **NOT contain the 'Ind AS Minor' column** required for proper classification of financial instruments according to IFRS 9/Ind AS 109 categories.

The available columns are:
- GL Description
- BSPL Category
- Major
- Minor
- Total June 25

**Impact**: Without the 'Ind AS Minor' column specifying measurement categories such as:
- "Financial Assets - Amortised Cost - Trade Receivables"
- "Financial Assets - FVTPL - Mutual Funds"
- "Financial Liabilities - Amortised Cost - Trade Payables"
- etc.

I cannot accurately classify the financial instruments according to Schedule III requirements.

## CRITICAL LIMITATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Missing Ind AS Minor Column**: The trial balance must include an 'Ind AS Minor' column with specific IFRS 9 measurement category classifications.

2. **Missing Period Column**: The required period column '(Unaudited) Jun'25' was not found. Analysis was performed using 'Total June 25'.

3. **Items Requiring Clarification**:
   - **Other Equity - Financial Liability** (₹13,16,92,755): This appears to be a financial liability but requires proper classification under IFRS 9 categories
   - Trade receivables and payables may exist but are not identifiable in the current data structure

4. **Recommendation**: Please provide the trial balance with:
   - 'Ind AS Minor' column containing IFRS 9/Ind AS 109 measurement categories
   - '(Unaudited) Jun'25' period column
   - Clear indication of which items qualify as financial instruments per Ind AS 109
