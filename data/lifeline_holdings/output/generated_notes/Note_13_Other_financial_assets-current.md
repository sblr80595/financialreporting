## Analysis & Notes:

Based on my review of the trial balance data provided for the period (Unaudited) Jun'25, **no GL accounts were identified that fall under the 'Other financial assets-current' category** as per Ind AS classification requirements.

**Observations:**
- The trial balance contains accounts related to:
  - **Balance Sheet items**: Cash in Bank, Investments in Associates, Due from related party, Borrowings, Equity, Retained Earnings
  - **Profit & Loss items**: Various expense and income accounts
  
- **For 'Other financial assets-current'**, we would typically expect accounts such as:
  - Security deposits (current)
  - Advances to suppliers (current)
  - Receivables from customers
  - Other current financial receivables
  - Accrued interest receivable (classified as financial assets)

- The trial balance includes an "Interest receivable" account with a balance of ₱ 0.00, which technically could be classified under other financial assets-current, but with a zero balance, the total remains **₱ 0.00**.
