# FINANCIAL NOTE GENERATION - REVENUE FROM OPERATION

## Analysis of Trial Balance Data

I have reviewed the trial balance data provided for the period **(Unaudited) Jun'25**.

---

## Issue Identified

**CRITICAL FINDING:** 

After thoroughly examining the trial balance data against the **'Minor' (Ind AS Minor) column**, I must report that:

### No Revenue From Operation Items Found

The trial balance data does **NOT contain any GL accounts** classified under the 'Minor' category that would constitute **'Revenue From Operation'** for Schedule III compliance.

**Analysis Performed:**
- ✓ Scanned all 28 GL account records
- ✓ Filtered by 'Minor' column values
- ✓ Searched for typical revenue categories (sales, service revenue, rental income, etc.)
- ✓ Extracted all values from **(Unaudited) Jun'25** column exclusively

**Findings:**
- **BS (Balance Sheet) Accounts:** 14 records - These are asset, liability, and equity items
- **PL (Profit & Loss) Accounts:** 14 records - Consisting of:
  - Other Expenses (Miscellaneous, Professional fees, Bank charges, etc.)
  - Employee benefits expense
  - **Other Income:** Interest Income (₱ -210.00), Dividend Income (₱ 0.00)
  - **Other Expenses:** Interest Expense (₱ 4,922,037.26)

**For Compliance:**
The trial balance data provided does not include any operating revenue items. If this is a complete trial balance for the organization, it indicates:

2. The entity may be:
   - In a pre-revenue stage
   - A holding company with only investment income
   - Missing revenue GL accounts in the provided data

**Next Steps:**
- Verify if the complete chart of accounts was provided
- Confirm if there are separate revenue GL accounts not included in this dataset
