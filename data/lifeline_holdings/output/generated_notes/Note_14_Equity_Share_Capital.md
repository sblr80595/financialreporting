# FINANCIAL NOTE GENERATION - EQUITY SHARE CAPITAL

## Analysis of Trial Balance Data

I have reviewed the trial balance data provided. However, I need to report a **critical issue**:

### ⚠️ COLUMN NAME MISMATCH

The trial balance CSV contains the column header: **`Total June 25`**

However, the instruction specifies to use: **`(Unaudited) Jun'25`**

These column names **do not match exactly**. I will proceed using the available column `Total June 25` as the primary data source, interpreting this as the June 2025 unaudited period data.

## Notes to the Calculation:

1. **Data Source**: All amounts extracted from the `Total June 25` column (interpreted as unaudited June 2025 data)
2. **Sign Convention**: Credit balances in the trial balance (shown as negative values) have been converted to positive amounts for presentation in the Balance Sheet equity section
3. **Categories Identified**:
   - Ordinary common shares A (from Everlife Holdings Pte Limited): Credit balance of -906,500,000.00 → Presented as ₱ 906,500,000.00
   - Redeemable preferred shares (from Everlife Holdings Pte Limited): Credit balance of -27,930,000.00 → Presented as ₱ 27,930,000.00
   - Ordinary common shares b (from Mukesh): Credit balance of -25,000,000.00 → Presented as ₱ 25,000,000.00
4. **No Authorised Share Capital**: The trial balance does not contain a distinct line item for "Authorised share capital", therefore only issued, subscribed and fully paid-up capital is presented.
