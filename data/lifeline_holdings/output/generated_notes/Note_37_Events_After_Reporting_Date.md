## Compliance Statement

This note is prepared in compliance with **Ind AS 10 - Events After the Reporting Period**, which requires the disclosure of:
- **Adjusting events** that provide evidence of conditions existing at the reporting date, and
- **Non-adjusting events** that are indicative of conditions arising after the reporting date but are of such importance that their non-disclosure would affect the ability of users of financial statements to make proper evaluations and decisions.

Based on the trial balance data provided, no such material events have been identified for disclosure.

**Note:** The disclosure of 'Events After Reporting Date' is qualitative in nature and requires narrative disclosure rather than quantitative amounts. The trial balance provided does not contain specific GL accounts designated for post-reporting date events. Therefore, the note reflects that no material events have been identified for the reporting period ended June 25, 2025.
