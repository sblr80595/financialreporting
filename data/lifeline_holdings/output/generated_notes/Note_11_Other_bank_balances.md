## Reconciliation Note

**Analysis:**
The trial balance data shows two bank balance entries classified under "(ii) Cash and cash equivalents" with the 'Minor' category of "Bank Balance":
- Cash in Bank - RCBC: ₱ 42,749.51
- Cash in Bank - CITI: ₱ 482,323.50
- **Total: ₱ 525,073.01**

However, as per the instruction to generate "Other bank balances" specifically for the Profit & Loss Statement note (NOTE 11), and noting that these entries are Balance Sheet items (BSPL Category = "BS"), they do not appear in the P&L Statement. The P&L Statement focuses on income and expense items. Therefore, **NOTE 11: OTHER BANK BALANCES for the Profit & Loss Statement is ₱ 0.00**.
