# FINANCIAL NOTE GENERATION REPORT

## ERROR NOTIFICATION

**Status**: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE DATA - NOTE CANNOT BE GENERATED

---

## Issue Identified:

The trial balance data provided does **NOT contain the required period column** for this analysis.

### Column Mismatch:
- **Expected Column**: `(Unaudited) Jun'25`
- **Actual Column Found**: `Total June 25`

### Critical Requirement:
Per the instructions, I must use **ONLY** the column named `(Unaudited) Jun'25` for all calculations and amounts.

The provided CSV contains a column labeled `Total June 25`, which does not match the required `(Unaudited) Jun'25` column specification.

## Action Required:

Please provide the trial balance data with the correct column header:
- **Column Name**: `(Unaudited) Jun'25` (case-sensitive)

Alternatively, if the column `Total June 25` is intended to be used as the June 2025 unaudited data, please confirm and resubmit with the corrected column name.
