## ANALYSIS SUMMARY

After carefully analyzing the trial balance data from TB_FINAL_LIFELINE_HOLDINGS.csv for the period **(Unaudited) Jun'25**, I must report the following:

### DATA AVAILABILITY ISSUE

**The trial balance provided does NOT contain the required 'Ind AS Minor' classifications** needed to generate Note 33: Financial Instruments - Risk Management.

- Bank Balance

- Interest receivable
- Due from a related party
- Accrued expense
- Loan from Related Parties

- etc.

However, **NONE of the specific Ind AS Minor categories required for Note 33 are present** in the data:

### Required Categories (NOT FOUND):
❌ "Trade Receivables Gross"
❌ "ECL Provision"
❌ "FL Maturity < 1 year"

## RECOMMENDATIONS

To generate Note 33: Financial Instruments - Risk Management properly, the trial balance needs to include:

1. **Trade Receivables with ECL provisions** - classified with appropriate Ind AS Minor tags
2. **Financial Liabilities bucketed by maturity** - with classifications like "FL Maturity < 1 year", "FL Maturity 1-5 years", "FL Maturity > 5 years"
3. **Foreign Currency Exposure details** - with "Net Foreign Currency Exposure" classification
4. **Interest Rate Risk details** - with "Variable Rate Borrowings" classification

**Note:** The current trial balance shows borrowings (Loan from Related Parties: ₹20,50,37,812) and accruals in foreign currencies (SGD: ₹36,86,201, USD: ₹7,49,689), but these are not classified in the format required for Schedule III risk management disclosures.

Please provide an updated trial balance with the proper Ind AS Minor classifications for financial instruments risk management categories.
