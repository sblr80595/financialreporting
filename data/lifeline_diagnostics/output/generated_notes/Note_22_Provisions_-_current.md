### Notes to the Financial Statements:

This note discloses current provisions recognized in the balance sheet as per Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

**Provision for Income Tax**: This represents the estimated tax liability on taxable income for the current year as per Income Tax Act, 1961. The provision includes:

1. **Income Tax Payable (GL 21202060)**: ₹52,74,520.32 - Represents the income tax liability for the current assessment year based on the taxable income computed as per Income Tax Act provisions.

2. **Creditable EWT (Expanded Withholding Tax) (GL 11402010)**: ₹8,89,510.68 - Represents withholding tax credits available that are adjustable against the final tax liability. This is netted against the gross tax provision as it represents advance tax payment through withholding mechanism.

**Net Current Tax Provision**: ₹61,64,031.00

This provision represents the current portion of income tax liability expected to be settled within 12 months from the reporting date, after adjusting for advance tax payments and tax credits available.

- The provision may be subject to adjustment upon filing of final income tax return or completion of tax assessment by authorities
- Any differences between estimated provision and actual tax liability determined will be adjusted in the period of determination
