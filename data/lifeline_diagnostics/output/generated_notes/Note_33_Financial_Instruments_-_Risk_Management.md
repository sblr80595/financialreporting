## IMPORTANT NOTE:

**The trial balance provided does not contain the specific 'Ind AS Minor' category classifications required for Note 33: Financial Instruments - Risk Management.**

To generate this note accurately, the following information is required:

1. **Credit Risk - Trade Receivables Ageing:**
   - Breakdown of trade receivables by ageing buckets (0-6 months, 6-12 months, >12 months)

2. **Liquidity Risk - Financial Liabilities Maturity:**
   - Classification of financial liabilities by maturity periods (<1 year, 1-5 years, >5 years)

3. **Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exposure:**
   - Separate identification of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables
   - Variable rate borrowings details

**Current Trial Balance Limitations:**
- Trade receivables are shown by customer type (Government Hospitals, Private Hospitals, Dealers, etc.) but not by ageing
- Financial liabilities are shown by nature (Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, etc.) but not by maturity periods
- Foreign currency transactions exist but are not separately classified as receivables/payables

**Recommendation:**
Please provide either:
1. A supplementary schedule with trade receivables ageing analysis
2. A maturity analysis of financial liabilities
3. Foreign currency exposure details
4. An updated trial balance with the required 'Ind AS Minor' classifications

This note typically requires data from auxiliary schedules or detailed subsidiary ledgers rather than the main trial balance, as it involves regrouping financial instruments by risk characteristics (ageing, maturity, currency) rather than by nature of transaction.
