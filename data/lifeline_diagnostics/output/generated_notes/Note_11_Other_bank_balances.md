### Explanation:

Based on the trial balance data provided, there are no accounts classified under the 'Ind AS Minor' category that corresponds to "Other bank balances" for Schedule III purposes.

The trial balance contains various bank accounts (GL codes 11102010 to 11102180) which are classified under 'Ind AS Minor' as "**Cash and cash equivalents - Bank Balance**" rather than "Other bank balances."

**Note:** "Other bank balances" typically include:
- Deposits with maturity of more than 3 months but less than 12 months
- Earmarked balances (such as unpaid dividend accounts, margin money deposits)
- Balances held as security against borrowings, guarantees, or other commitments
- Balances with restrictions on use

Since no such categories exist in the provided trial balance data with appropriate classification, this note is shown as "Nil".

All bank balances in the trial balance are classified under "Cash and cash equivalents" and would be reported under Note 10: Cash and Cash Equivalents instead.
