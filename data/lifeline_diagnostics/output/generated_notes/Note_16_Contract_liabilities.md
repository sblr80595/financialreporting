**Explanation:**

Based on the trial balance data provided, there are no accounts classified under the 'Ind AS Minor' category for "Contract Liabilities" as typically defined under Ind AS 115 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). 

Contract liabilities typically represent:
- Advance payments received from customers
- Deferred revenue
- Unearned revenue

While the trial balance includes account "21102050 - Advances from Customers" with a balance of ₹(20,28,143.85), this account is classified under 'Ind AS Minor' as "Advances from Customers" under "Other current liabilities" rather than specifically as "Contract Liabilities" per the Ind AS classification scheme used in your chart of accounts.

If "Advances from Customers" should be reclassified as Contract Liabilities for Ind AS 115 compliance, please confirm and I can regenerate this note accordingly. Otherwise, based on the current classification in the trial balance, the Contract Liabilities balance is ₹0.
