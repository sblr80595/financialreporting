**Key Observations:**
1. The trial balance does not contain any GL accounts mapped to current loan categories
2. All loan-related entries in the trial balance are classified under different categories (e.g., "Notes Payable" under borrowings, "Car Loans" under borrowings)
3. No entries were found matching typical current loan classifications such as:
   - Loans to employees (current portion)
   - Loans to related parties (current portion)
   - Loans to subsidiaries/associates (current portion)

The trial balance shows borrowings (liabilities) such as Notes Payable (₹10,00,00,000.00) and Car Loans (₹47,87,096.77), which would be classified under "Borrowings" rather than "Loans" in the Balance Sheet.
