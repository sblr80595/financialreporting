3. **Classification**: Since the net position is a debit balance (asset), this amount should technically be classified under "Deferred tax assets (net)" rather than "Deferred tax liabilities (net)" as per Ind AS 12 requirements.

4. **Ind AS 12 Compliance**: The deferred tax position represents temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their corresponding tax bases. Common sources include:
   - Differences in depreciation rates between books and tax
   - Provisions not allowed for tax purposes until actual payment
   - Carry-forward losses and unabsorbed depreciation (if any)

5. **Recognition**: Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized.

6. **Presentation Note**: As per Ind AS 12 and Schedule III requirements, when the net position is an asset (as in this case), it should be presented under Non-current Assets as "Deferred tax assets (net)" rather than under Non-current Liabilities.
