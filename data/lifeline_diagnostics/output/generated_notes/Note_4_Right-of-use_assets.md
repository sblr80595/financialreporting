### Important Notes:

1. **Data Quality Issue:** The trial balance contains an ERROR value in the Accumulated Depreciation account (GL Code: 12603020) for right-of-use assets. This is a critical data quality issue that prevents:
   - Accurate presentation of accumulated depreciation
   - Calculation of net carrying amount
   - Complete compliance with Ind AS 116 disclosure requirements

2. **Required Action:** Please verify and correct the Accumulated Depreciation value in the trial balance to enable complete preparation of this note.

3. **Accounting Context:**
   - Right-of-use assets represent the lessee's right to use underlying assets under lease arrangements as per Ind AS 116
   - These assets are typically depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset
   - The gross carrying amount of ₹14,80,67,434.52 represents the initial recognition of ROU assets
   - Accumulated depreciation should reflect the systematic depreciation charged since lease commencement

4. **Schedule III Compliance:** Once the error is resolved, the note should present:
   - Gross carrying amount (cost/fair value at recognition)
   - Less: Accumulated depreciation (as a deduction)
   - Net carrying amount (closing balance sheet value)
