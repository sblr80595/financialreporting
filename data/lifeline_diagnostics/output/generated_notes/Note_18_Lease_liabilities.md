### Accounting Policy:

Lease liabilities represent the present value of future lease payments for right-of-use assets recognized under Ind AS 116. The liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or the incremental borrowing rate if the implicit rate cannot be readily determined.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if there is a change in the Company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.

- **Depreciation on right-of-use assets**: Refer to Note 32 (Depreciation and amortization) for depreciation expense of ₹38,91,727.02 on right-of-use assets

### Maturity Analysis:

- **Current portion (within 12 months)**: ₹2,21,19,491.89 (38.3% of total lease liabilities)
- **Non-current portion (after 12 months)**: ₹3,56,54,461.56 (61.7% of total lease liabilities)
