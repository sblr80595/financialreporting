### Key Observations:

1. **Loss Position:** The Company has reported a net loss of ₹(2,29,70,544) for the period ending March 2025, resulting in negative Basic and Diluted EPS of ₹(1.12) per share.

2. **No Dilutive Instruments:** No convertible debt/equity, warrants, options, or share application money pending allotment were identified in the trial balance for March 2025. Therefore, Basic EPS equals Diluted EPS.

3. **Capital Structure:** The paid-up equity share capital is ₹(2,04,36,545) [shown as negative in trial balance, representing credit balance]. Assuming a face value of ₹10 per share, this represents 2,04,36,545 equity shares outstanding.

4. **Reserves Position:** The Company has accumulated losses reflected in Retained Earnings of ₹(8,13,23,421), which significantly exceeds the paid-up share capital.

5. **Share-Based Payments:** A Share Based Payment Reserve of ₹(10,40,663) exists, indicating employee stock option schemes. However, these do not appear to have dilutive impact as no outstanding convertible instruments were identified.

### Footnote:

**Note:** The earnings per share calculation is based on the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Since the Company has reported a loss for the period, both Basic and Diluted EPS are negative. The computation of diluted EPS does not assume conversion of potential equity shares as there were no dilutive instruments outstanding as at March 31, 2025.

**Period June 2025:** Auxiliary data file 'PL_Statement_XLSX' was not provided with June 2025 earnings data. Therefore, EPS calculation for June 2025 cannot be computed. If required, please provide the Profit & Loss statement for the quarter ending June 2025 for complete multi-period EPS analysis.

## CALCULATION METHODOLOGY:

**Step 1: Extract Numerator (Profit/Loss)**
- Sourced from trial balance P&L accounts (in absence of auxiliary PL_Statement_XLSX)
- Net Loss for Mar'25 = ₹(2,29,70,544) [computed from trial balance revenue, expenses, and tax accounts]

**Step 2: Calculate Denominator (Basic Shares)**
- Paid-up Equity Share Capital = ₹2,04,36,545 (absolute value)
- Assumed Face Value = ₹10 per share
- Number of shares = 2,04,36,545 ÷ 10 = **2,04,36,545 shares**

**Step 3: Compute EPS**
- Basic EPS = (₹2,29,70,544) ÷ 2,04,36,545 = **₹(1.12)** [rounded to 2 decimals]
- Diluted EPS = Basic EPS (no dilutive instruments) = **₹(1.12)**
