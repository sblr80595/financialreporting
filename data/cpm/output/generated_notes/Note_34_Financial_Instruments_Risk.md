### **2. Summary Table: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RISK**

#### **A) Credit Risk**
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

**Credit Risk Exposure (as at 31 March 2025)**
*Note: The following balances are derived from the Trial Balance.*

| Particulars | Amount (MYR) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Financial Assets Exposed to Credit Risk** | |
| Trade receivables | 23,928,589 |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 7,836,864 |
| Loans to related parties | 2,267,719 |
| Other financial assets | 2,449,275 |
| ****Total Credit Risk Exposure**** | **36,482,447** |

#### **B) Liquidity Risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation.
