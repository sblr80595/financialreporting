#### **2. Fair Value Measurement**

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Company considers that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recognised in the financial statements approximate their fair values.

**As at 31 March 2025**

| Particulars | Carrying Value (₹) | Fair Value (₹) |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| **Financial Assets** | | |
| Trade receivables | ₹2,39,28,589 | ₹2,39,28,589 |
| Cash and cash equivalents | ₹78,36,864 | ₹78,36,864 |
| Loans | ₹22,67,719 | ₹22,67,719 |
| Other financial assets | ₹4,43,426 | ₹4,43,426 |
| ****Total Financial Assets**** | **₹3,44,76,598** | **₹3,44,76,598** |
| **Financial Liabilities** | | |
| Borrowings | ₹24,96,06,243 | ₹24,96,06,243 |
| Trade payables | ₹1,77,54,281 | ₹1,77,54,281 |
| Lease liabilities | ₹5,68,967 | ₹5,68,967 |
| Other financial liabilities | ₹30,34,351 | ₹30,34,351 |
| ****Total Financial Liabilities**** | **₹27,09,63,842** | **₹27,09,63,842** |

#### **3. Fair Value Hierarchy**

This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are recognised and measured at fair value in the financial statements. To provide an indication of the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard.

| Particulars | Amount (₹) |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Fair Value Hierarchy as at 31 March 2025** | |
| Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities | ₹0 |
| Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly | ₹0 |
| Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) | ₹30,54,40,440 |
| **Fair value of instruments measured at amortised cost for which fair value is disclosed: Level 3** | **₹30,54,40,440** |

For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, the carrying value is approximately equal to the fair value. These fair values are determined using valuation techniques that utilise inputs that are not based on observable market data, and are therefore classified as Level 3. These techniques include discounted cash flow analysis, which considers factors such as credit risk and interest rates.
