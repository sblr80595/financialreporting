## Notes:
1. **Foreign Exchange Exclusion**: All foreign exchange gain/loss items (GL codes 85035000-85035032, 85035010-85035025, 85035030) have been EXCLUDED from this note as per classification rules. These belong in Note 25 (Other Income).
2. **Loss on Sale of PPE**: GL 73500000 shows a debit balance of RM 4,816.00, which represents a gain on disposal. As per CRITICAL FILTERING RULES, only DEBIT (positive) balances are included as losses. Since this is technically a gain (credit would show as negative), the RM 4,816.00 debit amount is included.
3. **Rent Exclusion**: Rent items (GL codes 84031010, 82510000, 80540000) have been EXCLUDED from Miscellaneous expenses as per the exclusion rules.
4. **Currency**: All amounts formatted in Malaysian Ringgit (RM) as required.
5. **Reconciliation**: The GL-level breakdown total (RM 8,666,833.00) reconciles with the summary note total.
