### Inventories at the Beginning of the Period (Opening Inventory):
**Note:** Based on the trial balance data provided for Total Mar'25, Opening Balance information for inventory accounts is not separately detailed in the 'Opening Balance' column. The closing balances from the previous period would serve as the opening balances for the current period.

Since Opening Balance columns are not provided in the CSV data, the opening inventory values cannot be extracted. The closing inventory amounts are calculated from the current period balances as shown above.

## Note on Data Limitation:
The trial balance CSV provided does not contain distinct 'Opening Balance' and 'Closing Balance' columns as separate fields. The amounts extracted are based on the 'Total Mar'25' column values. To calculate the precise net change in inventories (Opening minus Closing), detailed Opening Balance information would be required, which should typically be sourced from the balance sheet as at the beginning of the period (31 December 2024 or relevant prior period date).
