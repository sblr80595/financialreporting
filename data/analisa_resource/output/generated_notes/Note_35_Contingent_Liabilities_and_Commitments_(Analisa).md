**IMPORTANT OBSERVATION:**

The trial balance provided does not contain any GL codes mapped to contingent liabilities or commitments categories. This could mean either:
1. The company genuinely has no contingent liabilities or commitments to report, OR
2. These items may be tracked in a separate schedule/register outside the main trial balance

If contingent liabilities and commitments exist, they would typically need to be:
- Maintained in a separate memorandum record
- Provided as supplementary information to the trial balance
- Included in the notes to accounts based on management representation
