## QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES

### (A) Credit Risk

**Nature of Credit Risk:**
The Company's credit risk arises principally from trade receivables from customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of financial assets in the balance sheet. The Company has implemented a policy of dealing only with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral/security deposits where appropriate.

**Credit Risk Management:**
- Trade receivables are subject to credit evaluations based on customer's financial condition, past experience, and other factors
- The Company applies the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses (ECL) using a provision matrix based on historical credit loss experience
- As at June 30, 2025, the Company has not recorded any provision for doubtful debts, indicating a strong collection track record

**Credit Quality:**
All trade receivables are classified as "good and unsecured" with no credit-impaired financial assets identified during the period.

---

### (B) Liquidity Risk

**Nature of Liquidity Risk:**
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.

**Liquidity Risk Management:**
- The Company maintains adequate cash and cash equivalents (₹31,22,352.03) and other bank balances including fixed deposits (₹10,18,912.76)
- Management monitors rolling forecasts of liquidity reserves based on expected cash flows
- The Company has access to adequate financing facilities through related party arrangements

**Maturity Analysis:**
The contractual maturities of financial liabilities are presented in the table above. The majority of liabilities (99.71%) are due within one year, primarily comprising:
- Trade payables to suppliers: ₹24,36,881.47
- Amount owing to holding company: ₹4,26,21,250.00
- Deferred consideration: ₹1,74,17,222.00

### (C) Market Risk

**I. Foreign Currency Risk**

**Nature of Foreign Currency Risk:**
The Company operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency (Malaysian Ringgit). The primary exposure is to US Dollar (USD) and Singapore Dollar (SGD).

**Foreign Currency Exposure:**
As at June 30, 2025, the Company has:
- Foreign currency denominated bank balances (primarily USD): ₹6,81,015.06
- Foreign currency trade payables: ₹10,72,091.70
- **Net exposure (liability position): ₹(3,91,076.64)**

**Foreign Currency Sensitivity:**
A 5% appreciation/depreciation of foreign currencies against the Malaysian Ringgit would impact profit before tax by approximately ₹19,554 (5% of net exposure). The Company does not currently use derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk.

**II. Interest Rate Risk**

**Nature of Interest Rate Risk:**
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

**Interest Rate Exposure:**
As at June 30, 2025, the Company has:
- **No variable rate borrowings outstanding**
- Fixed deposits earning fixed interest income
- Lease liabilities carrying implicit fixed interest rates

The Company has minimal exposure to interest rate risk as it has no variable rate debt instruments. Interest income from fixed deposits amounted to ₹12,433.54 for the period. The Company's lease liabilities under Ind AS 116 carry implicit fixed interest rates determined at lease commencement, with interest expense of ₹6,781.76 recognized during the period.

---

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

1. **Capital Risk Management:** The Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure. The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

2. **Fair Value:** The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.

3. **Related Party Exposure:** Significant financial liability exists with the holding company (Everlife Holdings Pte Ltd) amounting to ₹4,26,21,250.00, representing intercompany financing arrangements.

4. **Credit Concentration:** The Company's trade receivables are spread across multiple customers in the life sciences sector, reducing concentration risk.
