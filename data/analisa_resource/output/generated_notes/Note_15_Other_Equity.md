## Notes:
1. This note is not applicable as there are no other equity components mapped in the trial balance under the 'Ind AS Minor' column.
2. All equity-related items in the trial balance are classified under "Equity share capital" and "Reserves and surplus" (which includes Retained Earnings), and these are presented separately in the Balance Sheet as per Schedule III requirements.
3. The categories typically included under "Other Equity" such as:
   - Capital Reserve
   - Securities Premium
   - General Reserve
   - Other Comprehensive Income items
   - Money received against share warrants
   
   are not present in the current trial balance data.

4. The retained earnings balance of ₹28,777,914.53 (GL Code: 32000000), dividend of ₹(21,800,000.00) (GL Code: 33000000), and profit for the period of ₹1,290,100.51 (Profit Period-jun FS) are part of "Reserves and surplus" and would be presented under that classification in the Balance Sheet, not under a separate "Other Equity" note.
