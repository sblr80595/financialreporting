## NOTES:

1. **Opening Balance**: No specific GL code identified in trial balance for lease liability opening balance, hence shown as ₹0. The current closing balances represent the position as at 30 June 2025.

2. **Additions**: No specific GL code for lease additions identified in the trial balance data provided.

3. **Payments**: No specific GL code for lease payments identified in the trial balance data provided. Cash outflow information not available in the trial balance.

4. **Asset Categories**: The trial balance does not contain specific GL codes with Ind AS Minor descriptions matching "Canon 1", "Canon 2", "IR-ADV DX C5860I", "Office", or "IR-ADV DX C5860I SN 2XP13285". These appear to be specific asset identifiers that are not separately tracked in the current GL structure.

5. **ROU Asset**: The Right-of-Use Asset comprises office premises and equipment with a net book value of ₹4,56,972.74 as at 30 June 2025.
