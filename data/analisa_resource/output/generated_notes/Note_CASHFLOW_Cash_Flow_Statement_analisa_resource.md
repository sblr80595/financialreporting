# CASH FLOW STATEMENT ANALISA_RESOURCE

## Error Report

I have reviewed the trial balance data provided, but I must report a **critical issue**:

### Issue Identified:
**Column 'Total Mar'25' NOT FOUND in the dataset**

The trial balance CSV contains only one period column:
- **'Total June 25'** (Available)

### Required Action:
According to the instructions, I am instructed to:
> "You MUST use the column 'Total Mar'25' for ALL calculations and amounts in this note."
> "If 'Total Mar'25' is not found, report an error"

### Current Status:
❌ **Cannot proceed with Cash Flow Statement Analysis**

The data provided contains 'Total June 25' values, but the system is configured to extract data from 'Total Mar'25' column exclusively.

## Recommendation:

Please provide one of the following:

1. **Trial balance data with 'Total Mar'25' column**, OR
2. **Confirmation to use 'Total June 25' column** (requires instruction override)

Once the correct period data is available, I will generate the complete:
- GL Level Breakdown for CASHFLOW
- Summary Cash Flow Statement Analysis Resource in Schedule III compliant format

**Status**: ⏸️ **PENDING DATA CORRECTION**
