## NOTES:

1. **Nature of Deferred Tax**: Deferred tax liabilities (net) represent the net position after offsetting deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities as per Ind AS 12 (Income Taxes).

2. **Basis of Calculation**: Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their corresponding tax base.

3. **Net Position**: The credit balance of ₹1,00,473.00 in the trial balance indicates a net deferred tax liability position, meaning deferred tax liabilities exceed deferred tax assets.

4. **Common Sources**: Deferred tax typically arises from:
   - Differences in depreciation rates (book vs. tax)
   - Provisions not allowed for tax purposes until actual payment
   - Carried forward tax losses and unabsorbed depreciation
   - Differences in revenue recognition
   - Lease accounting under Ind AS 116

5. **Presentation**: As per Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013, deferred tax liabilities (net) are classified as non-current liabilities and presented separately from current tax liabilities.

6. **Offsetting**: Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset as the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax relates to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
