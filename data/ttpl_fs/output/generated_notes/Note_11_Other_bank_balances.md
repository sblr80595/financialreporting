## NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS:

### Analysis of Trial Balance Data:

Upon detailed examination of the trial balance data provided, **no GL accounts were found** with the Ind AS Minor classification of **"Fixed deposits with banks with original maturity period of more than 12 months"**.

The trial balance contains the following fixed deposit accounts, but they are classified under different maturity categories:

**Fixed Deposits with maturity of 3-12 months (classified under Current Assets):**
- GL 200192: Fixed Deposit With HDFC Bank - ₹5,45,129
- GL 200194: Fixed Deposit With ICICI Bank - ₹2,88,954
- GL 200191: Fixed Deposit With Kotak Bank - ₹15,810
- GL 200193: Fixed Deposit With BOB Bank - ₹11,808
- GL 200187: Margin money (HDFC-FD-200180) - ₹2,06,349
- GL 200195: Fixed Deposit With CITI Bank - ₹9,790

All these accounts are classified under the Ind AS Minor category: **"Fixed deposit with maturities more than three months but less than twelve months"**, which means they are current assets (maturity < 12 months from reporting date).

### Accounting Treatment:

As per Ind AS 1 and Schedule III requirements:
- Fixed deposits with **original maturity > 12 months** are classified as **Non-Current Assets** under "Other bank balances"
- Fixed deposits with maturity of **3-12 months** are classified as **Current Assets**
- Fixed deposits with maturity **< 3 months** are classified as **Cash and Cash Equivalents**

Since the company has no fixed deposits with original maturity exceeding 12 months as of June 2025, this note appropriately reflects a **NIL balance**.
