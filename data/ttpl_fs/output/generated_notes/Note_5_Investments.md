## ANALYSIS AND NOTES:

**Data Processing Summary:**
- Filtered trial balance for 'Ind AS Minor' = "Investments (Non-current)" and "Investments (Current)"
- Period used for extraction: **(Unaudited) Jun'25**
- **Result: No GL codes found with these classifications**

**Observations:**
1. The trial balance provided does not contain any GL codes classified under:
   - "Investments (Non-current)"
   - "Investments (Current)"

2. A comprehensive review of the trial balance shows that TTPL does not hold any investments in equity instruments, mutual funds, or other investment securities as of June 2025.

3. The company's Balance Sheet (Assets side) reflects various other asset categories including:
   - Property, plant and equipment
   - Loans to related parties (classified under Long-term/Short-term loans and advances)
   - Inventories
   - Trade receivables
   - Cash and bank balances

4. **Loans to related parties** (such as Loan to Transvalve Health Private Limited, Halemed Medical Private Limited, and Transhealth Private Limited) are recorded under "Long-term loans and advances" and NOT under "Investments" as per the company's classification system.

**Accounting Context:**
- As per Ind AS 109, investments would be classified and measured at:
  - Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), or
  - Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)
- Since no investments exist, disclosure requirements under Ind AS 107 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures) related to investment categories are not applicable.

**Conclusion:**
TTPL has **NIL investments** as of June 2025. This note reflects a zero balance, which is compliant with Schedule III requirements for full disclosure of the Balance Sheet line item.
