## NOTE 34: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISK

**Period: (Unaudited) Jun'25**

### 34.1 LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation.

#### Maturity Analysis of Financial Liabilities

The table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted payments:

| Particulars | Total Carrying Amount (₹) | Less than 1 Year (₹) | 1 to 5 Years (₹) | More than 5 Years (₹) |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Trade Payables** | **78,077.95** | **78,077.95** | **-** | **-** |

### 34.2 CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, and other financial instruments.

#### Trade Receivables

Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company's established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment.

**Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Provision:**

The Company uses simplified approach for the purpose of computation of expected credit loss for trade receivables. The Company does not have significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Company's customer base being large and diverse. All trade receivables are reviewed and assessed for default on a quarterly basis.

The Company, based on past trends and expected credit losses, has provided for doubtful debts amounting to **₹347.67 lakhs** as at June 30, 2025 (refer Note 14).

#### Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company held cash and cash equivalents of **₹863.14 lakhs** at June 30, 2025 (refer Note 15). The cash and cash equivalents are held with reputed banks with high credit ratings assigned by credit-rating agencies.

---

### 34.3 MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, and investments.

#### A. Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company's operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency) and the Company's net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 12-month period for hedges of forecasted sales.

**Foreign Currency Exposure:**

The Company has unhedged foreign currency exposures as at the reporting date relating to:
- Trade receivables denominated in USD and EUR
- Trade payables denominated in USD, EUR and other foreign currencies
- Foreign currency cash and bank balances
- Foreign currency borrowings (Buyers Credit, FCNR)

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

A 5% appreciation/depreciation of the INR against foreign currencies would result in an increase/decrease in profit before tax by approximately **₹150-200 lakhs** based on the Company's net foreign currency exposure as at June 30, 2025.

#### B. Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company's debt obligations with floating interest rates.

**Exposure:**

The Company's borrowings are primarily at floating rates of interest, which expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. The Company's exposure to interest rate risk on its borrowings is as follows:

| Particulars | Amount (₹ in lakhs) |
|------------|---------------------|
| Floating Rate Borrowings | |
| - Cash Credit from Banks | 5,624.15 |
| - Buyers Credit | 1,565.63 |
| - FCNR Loan | 1,514.85 |
| - Loans from Related Parties | 12,906.04 |
| **Total Floating Rate Borrowings** | **21,610.67** |
| | |
| Fixed Rate Borrowings | |
| - Vehicle Loans | 40.44 |
| - Lease Liabilities | 1,977.10 |
| **Total Fixed Rate Borrowings** | **2,017.54** |

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

A change of 50 basis points (bps) in interest rates would result in an increase/decrease in profit before tax by approximately **₹108.05 lakhs** per annum based on the Company's floating rate borrowings as at June 30, 2025.

## Notes:

1. The above maturity analysis is based on contractual terms. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities.

2. The Company monitors rolling forecasts of liquidity on the basis of expected cash flows. The Company's treasury team monitors the level of liquid assets necessary to meet its liquidity requirements on a daily basis.

3. The Company has access to undrawn borrowing facilities of cash credit limits from banks to meet short-term funding requirements.

4. All amounts are stated in ₹ Lakhs unless otherwise specified.
