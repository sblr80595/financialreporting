# FINANCIAL NOTE GENERATION - SEGMENT INFORMATION

## NOTE 39: SEGMENT INFORMATION

### GL LEVEL BREAKDOWN FOR NOTE 39
**Period: (Unaudited) Jun'25**

After careful analysis of the trial balance data provided, I must report that:

**NO SEGMENT-SPECIFIC DATA FOUND**

The trial balance does not contain any GL entries with 'Ind AS Minor' classifications matching the required segment categories:
- "Segment Revenue - External - Segment A"
- "Segment Revenue - External - Segment B"
- "Segment Results (PBT) - Segment A"
- "Segment Results (PBT) - Segment B"
- "Segment Assets - Segment A"
- "Segment Assets - Segment B"
- "Segment Liabilities - Segment A"
- "Segment Liabilities - Segment B"

**Analysis:**
The 'Ind AS Minor' column in the provided trial balance contains various categories such as:
- Fixed Assets
- Right of use assets
- Inventories
- Trade receivables
- Cash and bank balances
- Employee benefits expense
- Finance costs
- Other expenses
- Sale of products
- Other Income
- Purchase of traded goods
- Cost of Goods Sold
- Tax expense
- Depreciation and amortisation expense

However, **none of these categories relate to segment reporting** as required by Ind AS 108.

## NOTE 39: SEGMENT INFORMATION
**For the period ended: (Unaudited) Jun'25**

### Disclosure Statement:

The Company has not separately identified or classified segment-specific data in its trial balance for the current reporting period. The trial balance does not contain GL accounts tagged with segment identifiers (Business Segments or Geographical Segments) as required for preparation of segment information under Ind AS 108.

**Ind AS 108 Compliance Note:**
Ind AS 108 - Operating Segments requires entities to disclose information about their operating segments, products and services, geographical areas, and major customers. Operating segments are components of an entity:
- That engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses incurred
- Whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)
- For which discrete financial information is available

### Segment Information Table:
**Period: (Unaudited) Jun'25**

| Particulars | Business Segment A | Business Segment B | Unallocated | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Revenue from External Customers** | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 |
| **Segment Result (Profit Before Tax)** | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 |
| **Segment Assets** | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 |
| **Segment Liabilities** | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 |
| **Capital Expenditure** | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 |
| **Depreciation and Amortisation** | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 | ₹0 |

**Note:** 
1. The Company has not maintained segment-wise bifurcation of financial data in its accounting system for the period under review.
2. Management may need to implement appropriate systems to capture segment-level information if multiple reportable segments exist as per Ind AS 108.
3. If the Company operates in a single business segment or if segment revenue does not meet the quantitative thresholds under Ind AS 108, this disclosure may not be applicable.

---

### Reconciliation to Financial Statements:

Since no segment data is available, reconciliation between segment information and financial statement totals cannot be provided. The following would typically be reconciled if segment data were available:

**Revenue Reconciliation:**
- Total revenue from all segments → Revenue as per Statement of Profit and Loss

**Profit Reconciliation:**
- Total segment profit before tax → Profit Before Tax as per Statement of Profit and Loss

**Asset Reconciliation:**
- Total segment assets → Total Assets as per Balance Sheet

**Liability Reconciliation:**
- Total segment liabilities → Total Liabilities as per Balance Sheet

---

### Recommendation:

To comply with Ind AS 108, the Company should:
1. Identify operating segments based on internal reporting reviewed by CODM
2. Tag GL accounts with appropriate segment identifiers
3. Maintain segment-wise revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities
4. Implement reporting mechanisms for segment disclosure

**IMPORTANT NOTE TO USER:**

The trial balance provided does not contain segment-specific data tagged in the 'Ind AS Minor' column as required for Ind AS 108 segment reporting. To generate meaningful segment information, the Company's chart of accounts needs to be enhanced to capture:

1. **Business Segment Classification** (e.g., Pharmaceutical Products, Medical Devices, etc.)
2. **Geographical Segment Classification** (e.g., Domestic, Export - Region wise)
3. Segment-wise tagging of revenues, costs, assets, and liabilities

Without this foundational data structure, segment reporting cannot be prepared in compliance with Ind AS 108 requirements.
