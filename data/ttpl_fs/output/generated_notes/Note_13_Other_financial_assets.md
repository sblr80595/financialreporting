## EXPLANATORY NOTE:

Based on the trial balance data provided and the Schedule III requirements for "Other Financial Assets", no entries were identified in the '(Unaudited) Jun'25' column that correspond to the typical classifications under this note category.

**Other Financial Assets** typically include items such as:
- Interest accrued but not due
- Security deposits (current portion)
- Other receivables classified as financial assets
- Derivative instruments (if any)
- Insurance claims receivable
- Other contractual rights to receive cash or financial assets

From the trial balance analysis:
- **Interest accrued (GL 200401)** shows ₹44.11 but is classified under "Other current assets" in the trial balance
- **Security deposits** are shown under "Long-term loans and advances"
- No other financial instruments or receivables are specifically categorized as "Other Financial Assets"

As per the strict filtering requirement by 'Ind AS Minor' column, and since no entries are explicitly tagged for "Other Financial Assets" classification in the balance sheet, this note shows a zero value.
