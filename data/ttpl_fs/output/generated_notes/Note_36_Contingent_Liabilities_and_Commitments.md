# FINANCIAL NOTE GENERATION - CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

## Analysis of Trial Balance Data

I have analyzed the trial balance data for the period **(Unaudited) Jun'25**. 

**CRITICAL FINDING:** No entries found matching the required 'Ind AS Minor' categories for Contingent Liabilities and Commitments:
- "Contingent Liabilities - Claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts"
- "Contingent Liabilities - Guarantees given"
- "Contingent Liabilities - Other contractual disputes"
- "Commitments - Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on Capital Account"

The trial balance provided does not contain any GL codes with these specific Ind AS Minor classifications in the 'Minor' column.

## Accounting Context & Disclosure Notes:

**Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:**

1. **Contingent Liabilities** represent possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. These are disclosed but not recognized on the Balance Sheet.

2. **Commitments** represent contractual obligations for future expenditure, primarily capital commitments, where the entity has a legal obligation but the liability has not yet been incurred.

3. **Current Status:** As of (Unaudited) Jun'25, the Company has no material contingent liabilities or capital commitments to disclose.

## IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. **Data Availability:** The trial balance provided does not contain entries categorized under the specific Ind AS Minor classifications required for this note.

2. **Nil Disclosure:** When there are no contingent liabilities or commitments, it is appropriate to present the note structure with nil values, as this provides transparency and confirms that the matter has been considered.

3. **Verification Required:** Management should verify whether:
   - Any contingent liabilities exist that should be disclosed
   - Any capital commitments have been entered into but not recorded in the trial balance
   - The trial balance mapping to Ind AS Minor categories is complete and accurate

4. **Audit Trail:** This nil disclosure should be reviewed and confirmed by management and auditors as part of the financial statement preparation process.
