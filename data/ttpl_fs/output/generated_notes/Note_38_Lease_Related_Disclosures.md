## Notes to the Disclosure:

1. **Compliance:** This note has been prepared in accordance with **Ind AS 116 - Leases**, which requires lessees to recognize lease-related assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and provide detailed disclosures about lease arrangements.

2. **Section A - Profit or Loss Impact:**
   - **Depreciation on ROU Assets (₹59.52 Lakhs):** Represents the systematic allocation of the right-of-use asset over the lease term, charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
   - **Finance Cost on Lease Liabilities (₹47.54 Lakhs):** Represents the interest expense on the lease liability, calculated using the effective interest rate method.

3. **Section B - Balance Sheet Impact:**
   - **Additions to ROU Assets (₹2,002.51 Lakhs):** Represents the carrying amount of right-of-use assets as at the reporting date. This includes the initial recognition of leased assets net of accumulated depreciation.
   - **Total Cash Outflow for Leases (₹0.00):** The trial balance does not contain a specific GL code capturing total lease payments made during the period. This should typically include both principal and interest components of lease payments.

4. **Section C - Maturity Analysis:**
   - The maturity analysis provides a breakdown of undiscounted future lease payment obligations by time bucket. 
   - **Data Limitation:** The trial balance contains only one line item for lease liability (GL Code 10081 - "Leased Liability LongTerm" with a balance of ₹1,977.10 Lakhs), classified under long-term borrowings with no separate split by maturity buckets.
   - **Classification Assumption:** The entire liability of ₹1,977.10 Lakhs has been presented under "More than 5 years" based on the GL description indicating it is a long-term liability. However, standard practice under Ind AS 116 requires a detailed maturity analysis showing:
     - Current portion (due within 1 year)
     - Non-current portion by buckets (1-5 years, >5 years)
   - **Recommendation:** The Company should maintain separate GL codes or sub-ledgers to track lease liabilities by maturity for accurate Ind AS 116 compliance.

5. **Accounting Policy:**
   - The Company recognizes right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities for all leases except short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
   - ROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset.
   - Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate.

6. **Reconciliation:**
   - **ROU Asset (Net):** GL Code 20024 (₹2,002.51) - GL Code 20023 (₹-278.82) = **₹1,723.69 Lakhs** (Net carrying amount)
   - The gross ROU asset value of ₹2,002.51 Lakhs represents additions/initial recognition, while accumulated depreciation of ₹278.82 Lakhs has been charged to date.
