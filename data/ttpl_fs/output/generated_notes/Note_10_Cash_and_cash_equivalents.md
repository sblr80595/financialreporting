## NOTES:

### Accounting Context:
As per Ind AS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows), Cash and Cash Equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

### Components:

**A. Balances with banks:**
- Current accounts include bank balances held with various banks (Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Citibank) that are readily available for use in operations.

**B. Cash on hand:**
- Includes cash in hand at various locations and foreign currency holdings.
- Post-dated cheques and cheques in hand are shown separately as they are not yet realized.

### Excluded Items:
The following items, though part of cash and bank balances, are NOT included in cash and cash equivalents as they do not meet the liquidity criteria:
- Fixed deposits (shown under Other bank balances)
- Bank balances in cash credit/overdraft accounts with negative balances (shown under Short-term borrowings)
- Margin money deposits
