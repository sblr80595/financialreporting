## NOTES AND ACCOUNTING CONTEXT:

### Basis of Recognition:
Lease liabilities have been recognized and measured in accordance with **Ind AS 116 - Leases**. The standard requires lessees to recognize a lease liability for the present value of future lease payments and a corresponding right-of-use asset for substantially all leases.

### Classification:
The total lease liability of ₹1,977.37 lakhs has been classified based on the maturity profile:

1. **Non-current liabilities (₹1,977.10 lakhs)**: Represents the portion of lease obligations due after 12 months from the reporting date. This is derived from GL Code 10081 - "Leased Liability LongTerm".

2. **Current liabilities (₹0.27 lakhs)**: Represents the current maturity of lease obligations due within 12 months from the reporting date. This is derived from GL Code 100202 - "Lease Equalisation Reserve".

### Presentation:
- Lease liabilities are presented as positive amounts in the Balance Sheet as they represent obligations of the Company.
- The values extracted from the trial balance have credit balances (shown as negative), which have been converted to positive amounts for presentation purposes.
- The total lease liability is segregated between non-current and current portions as required under Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013.

### Related Disclosures:
- Interest on lease liabilities amounting to ₹47.54 lakhs is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss (refer GL Code 400101).
- Depreciation on right-of-use assets amounting to ₹59.52 lakhs is included in depreciation expense (refer GL Code 400170).
- The carrying value of right-of-use assets is ₹1,723.69 lakhs (net of accumulated depreciation).
