## ACCOUNTING CONTEXT

This note complies with **Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers** and presents revenue disaggregated by:

1. **Nature of goods and services**: Sale of goods (pharmaceutical products including finished goods and traded goods), and service income
2. **Timing of transfer**: Revenue from sale of goods is recognized at a point in time (when control transfers to customer), while service income is recognized over the period of service delivery

**Key Components:**
- **Sale of Goods**: Includes domestic sales, trading sales, branch sales, export sales, and scrap sales, net of returns (expired, damaged, FOC), price variations, trade discounts, and volume discounts
- **Rendering of Services**: Income from services provided during the period
- **Net Revenue**: No GST/Excise Duty deductions were identified in the trial balance for the current period

The revenue recognition follows the five-step model prescribed by Ind AS 115, ensuring that revenue is recognized when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods or services to customers.
