### NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS:

**Accounting Context:**
- These are current financial liabilities measured at amortized cost as per Ind AS 109.
- They represent various short-term obligations that are financial in nature but are not trade payables or borrowings.
- Interest accrued but not due represents interest that has accumulated on borrowings but the payment date has not yet arrived.
- Employee related payables include amounts payable to employees for expenses incurred on behalf of the company.
- Other payables include various financial obligations such as expenses payable and other miscellaneous financial liabilities.

**Key Components:**

1. **Interest accrued but not due on borrowings (₹42.82 Lakhs):**
   - Represents interest that has accumulated on various borrowings (cash credit, term loans, lease liabilities, etc.) but is not yet due for payment as per the contractual terms.

2. **Employee related payables (₹1.87 Lakhs):**
   - Comprises amounts payable to employees for business-related expenses incurred by them on behalf of the company.

3. **Other payables (₹2,328.81 Lakhs):**
   - This is the largest component and includes various other financial payables such as professional fees, operational expenses, and other financial obligations that are not classified under trade payables or other specific categories.

**Note (i):** Other payables primarily consist of accrued expenses for services received but not yet invoiced, and other operational payables that are financial in nature.
