   - Names of partners and share capital issued

2. **Quantitative Reconciliation:**

   - Liabilities taken over at book value
   - Net assets transferred
   - Consideration paid (share capital issued to partners)

## POSSIBLE REASONS FOR NO DATA

1. **Company May Not Have Undergone Conversion:** The entity may not have been converted from a partnership firm to a company during the reporting period or prior periods presented.

2. **Data Classification Issue:** The trial balance may not have specific 'Ind AS Minor' classifications for conversion-related items. Such items may be:
   - Classified under generic equity/capital categories
   - Part of opening balances
   - Recorded in prior periods not included in this trial balance

3. **Historical Transaction:** If the conversion occurred in prior periods, the effects would be reflected in opening balances and retained earnings, not requiring separate note disclosure in current period.

4. **Alternative Classification:** Conversion-related amounts may be classified under:
   - "Partners' contribution" (noted as "Partners Capital Account")
   - "Partners' current account"
   - "Reserves and surplus"
   - "Opening Balance" accounts

**GL Codes Potentially Related (But Not Classified Under Required Categories):**
- GL 50011: Avnish Mehra Capital Account (₹-0.01)
- GL 50012: IHL Capital Account (₹0.00)
- GL 50028: Deemed Equity (₹-454.47)

## RECOMMENDATION

**If conversion disclosure is required, please:**

1. **Verify if conversion occurred:** Confirm whether the entity was indeed converted from a partnership to a company, and if so, the effective date.

2. **Review data classification:** Ensure conversion-related items in the trial balance are classified under appropriate 'Ind AS Minor' categories:
   - "Assets Taken Over at Book Value"
   - "Liabilities Taken Over at Book Value"
   - "Share Capital Issued to Partners"
   - "Capital Reserve arising on conversion"

3. **Historical records:** If conversion occurred in prior periods, provide:
   - Opening balance details
   - Conversion scheme documentation
   - Schedule of assets and liabilities transferred

4. **Manual input:** If data cannot be reclassified, provide the required information separately for manual note preparation.
