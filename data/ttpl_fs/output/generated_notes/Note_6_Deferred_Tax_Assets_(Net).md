## Notes and Explanations:

1. **Nature of Deferred Tax Assets (Net):**
   - Deferred Tax Assets (Net) represents the net deferred tax position after offsetting deferred tax liabilities against deferred tax assets as permitted under Ind AS 12 (Income Taxes).
   - The net amount of ₹1,307.91 lakhs is presented on the asset side of the Balance Sheet, indicating that deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities.

2. **Basis of Recognition:**
   - Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their corresponding tax bases.
   - Common temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets include:
     - Provisions for employee benefits (gratuity, leave encashment) recognized in books but allowed for tax purposes only on payment
     - Provision for doubtful debts
     - Provision for customer claims and sales returns
     - Unabsorbed depreciation or tax losses (if any)
     - Other timing differences where book expense exceeds tax-deductible expense

3. **Accounting Policy:**
   - Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
   - The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current assessment of future taxable profits.

4. **Presentation:**
   - As per Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS requirements, the net deferred tax position is presented as a single line item:
     - Net deferred tax asset is shown under "Non-Current Assets"
     - If the position were a net deferred tax liability, it would be shown under "Non-Current Liabilities"

5. **Reconciliation:**
   - The movement in deferred tax during the period is disclosed in Note 27 (Tax Expense) through the Deferred Tax Expense line item.
   - For the period ending (Unaudited) Jun'25, a deferred tax credit of ₹60.85 lakhs (refer GL Code 400903) has been recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss, which would have contributed to the net deferred tax asset position.
